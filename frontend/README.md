# Frontend (Vite + React)

Minimal React 18 app scaffolded with Vite.

Quick start:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The `src/` folder contains the requested structure:
- `api/`, `components/`, `pages/`, `context/`, `hooks/`, `utils/`
- `App.jsx`, `main.jsx`

No routing, authentication, or API logic added yet.
